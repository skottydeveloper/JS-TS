# Backend Challenges
## Summary
This is my attempt at FreeCodeCamp's "Managing Packages with NPM" course.

### To Note
The tests for this course were problematic, and as a result - I wasn't able to submit each challenge exercise, and mark them as complete. Nevertheless, everything that's required to be done is still finished - as I was able to simply go back to the course page, and click on the next exercise to do. 

To view each completed challenge exercise, simply view the commit history of the "package.json" file - a commit is made for each exercise.
