# Backend Challenges
## Summary
This is my attempt at FreeCodeCamp's "Managing Packages with NPM" course.

### To Note
The tests for this course were problematic, and as a result - I wasn't able to submit each exercise, and mark them as complete. Nevertheless, everything that's required to be done is finished - as I was able to simply go back to the course page, and click on the next exercise to do.
