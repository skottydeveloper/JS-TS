# Javascript/TypeScript
## Summary
This repository is a portfolio of code for the Javascript and TypeScript programming languages. It consists of projects I have completed, during uni and in my own time, while learning both languages.

## Notable Projects
### eRestaurant Web Application
Working in a team of six, we created a web application that allows for the user to register and log into the system, book an available table and make/modify a meal order. There's also a page that allows staff members, their roles and personal details being maintained.

### Contacts Viewer
This program is a contacts viewer, where you can view the contacts fetched from an API and search for a specific user from the list of contacts. You can also view extra details of a user, by clicking on the row of the user.

### Random Quote Machine
This program involves generating a random quote for the user. The user can press the "Get Quote" button to generate another random quote, or simply reload the page to do so. In addition, the user can also share the quote to their Twitter.
